                <p>The purpose of this experiment is to evaluate whether LLMs can be used for decision-making in collaborative tasks to enhance efficiency and safety by providing a high-level coding approach with emergent thinking properties, thereby reducing the need for explicit condition descriptions. We assume it encapsulates a certain common reasoning akin to that of a typical user. To ensure a safe collaboration between humans and robots, it is imperative to intervene whenever the robot poses a risk to the user. Common interventions include reducing speed and adjusting path planning. In conjunction with safety method porposed in the Safety part, we propose halting the robot when safety cannot be guaranteed. However, to prevent prolonged immobilization, we suggest employing a GPT decision maker to alter the current course of action. This could involve waiting, withdrawing from the current position, or pursuing a different objective. </p>

                <p>The robot's objective is to collect cubes and stack them together with a human collaborator. Four main parameters define different experiment scenarios. Firstly, the robot can either pick up a cube or place one. Secondly, the robot may encounter obstacles leading to its immobilization: the user could increase the safety index (SI) by moving closer to the robot, affecting the robot's speed, or obstruct the robot's path, rendering it unable to reach its objective. These interruptions occur at various distances from the current objective (between the end-effector of the robot and the current objective): short, medium, and long distances. A short distance is considered to be smaller than 20cm, a medium desitance would be between 20cm and 40cm and a larger disance is whenever the distance is bigger than 40cm.  Additionally, as depicted in the figure below, four different layouts will be explored. The first layout (on the left) presents another cube close to the current one for the robot to pick up. In the subsequent experiment, the robot still has another cube available but it is located much further away. The following experiment investigates GPT's decision-making when no other cubes are accessible for pickup. Lastly, the remaining layout examines scenarios where multiple cubes are available, both nearby and at a distance from the current layout. Each layout is tested for every possible parameter combination mentionned above. The goal of testing all of the following parameters is to attempt to recreate the most common scenarios that the robot can encounter while working on his task. </p>
